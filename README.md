# JavaScript Null and Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: how to handle `null` or `undefined` values in function parameters.  Improper handling can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates the correct approach.

This is a simple example, but the principle applies to more complex scenarios. Always validate your inputs before performing operations to prevent errors.
